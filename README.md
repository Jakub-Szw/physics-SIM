This is my training repository, where I will commit each learning step.
  In this repository, I'm using OpenGL, which Iâ€™m running through WSL, to create a physics simulator.
  To learn how to work with OpenGL properly, I'm using [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/), as well as Victor Gordan [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/@VictorGordan/playlists) about OpenGL. 
  As well as me just messing around.
